## Scenario:

A memory dump from a connected Linux machine reveals covert network connections, fake services, and unusual redirects. Holmes investigates further to uncover how the attacker is manipulating the entire network!

## Tools

- Vol3

in the first we use vol3 to check Debian version to download symbol

```bash
$ vol3 -f memdump.mem banner

Volatility 3 Framework 2.27.0
Progress:  100.00               PDB scanning finished
Offset  Banner

0x67200200      Linux version 5.10.0-35-amd64 (debian-kernel@lists.debian.org) (gcc-10 (Debian 10.2.1-6) 10.2.1 20210110, GNU ld (GNU Binutils for Debian) 2.35.2)

```

you can see linux version you can download it from here

[Download Link](https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/amd64/linux-image-5.10.0-35-amd64-dbg/download)

after download it let’s go to make it as a symbol to complete your analysis

```bash
$ $dpkg -x linux-image-5.10.0-35-amd64-dbg_5.10.237-1_amd64.deb

$ dwarf2json linux -elf from/path/usr/lib/debug/boot/vmlinux-5.10.0-35-amd64 --system-map path/usr/lib/debug/boot/System.map-5.10.0-35-amd64| xz -c > debian-11_5.10.0-35-amd64.json.xz

$ dpkg -x linux-image-5.10.0-35-amd64-dbg_5.10.237-1_amd64.deb .
```

after complete all steps now you are ready to investigate

## Task1 → What is the Linux kernel version of the provided image?

## ✅ Answer 5.10.0–35-amd64

## Task2 → The attacker connected over SSH and executed initial reconnaissance commands. What is the PID of the shell they used?

```bash
$ vol3 -f memdump.mem linux.bash

```

attacker after get initial access run some command to enumerate running process and discovery os version

## Task3 → After the initial information gathering, the attacker authenticated as a different user to escalate privileges. Identify and submit that user’s credentials.

from previous task we can found attacker start a docker container /etc/ file to /mnt, now you can enumerate file to get docker logs *json.log by usage this plugin `linux.pagecache.Files`

and `grep json.log` you can found a lot of file but when compare timestamp by timestamp in bash.history you can determine a correct file

```bash
0x9b33882a9000  /       8:1     1053804 0x9b3386436f80  REG     1       1       -rw-r-----      2025-09-03 08:17:30.003030 UTC  2025-09-03 08:18:08.715033 UTC  2025-09-03 08:18:08.715033 UTC  /var/lib/docker/containers/a1a73e71a21b324a37f3d02eaf3d15514898078716c13ab60b8f12adf21e4a5b/a1a73e71a21b324a37f3d02eaf3d15514898078716c13ab60b8f12adf21e4a5b-json.log  391

```

now let’s go to dump Docker logs file

```bash
python3 vol.py -f memdump.mem linux.pagecache.InodePages --inode  0x9b3386436f80  --dump

```

open a file and extract the hash and crack it usage wordlist rockyou.txt

## Task4 → The attacker downloaded and executed code from Pastebin to install a rootkit. What is the full path of the malicious file?

Volatility 3 provides several useful plugins for checking loaded kernel modules such as

```bash
python3 vol.py -f memdump.mem linux.malware.hidden_modules

```

![Image](/images/write-up/HackTheBox_Sherlock_Holmes_The_Tunnel_Without_Walls/1_4_1.jpg)

This plugin provides the name of the malicious kernel module and searches the file dump to retrieve its full path.

## Task5 → What is the email account of the alleged author of the malicious file?

Dump the malicious kernel module and inspect it using strings or modinfo after renaming the file with the .ko extension

```bash
python3 vol.py -f memdump.mem linux.pagecache.InodePages --inode  0x9b3386454a80  --dump

```

## Task6 → The next step in the attack involved issuing commands to modify the network settings and installing a new package. What is the name and PID of the package? (package name,PID)

Check the Bash history — you may find that the attacker installed the ‘dnsmasq’ package. Then enumerate the process list to obtain the process PID.

![Image](/images/write-up/HackTheBox_Sherlock_Holmes_The_Tunnel_Without_Walls/1_6_1.jpg)

```bash
python3 vol.py -f memdump.mem linux.pslist | grep dnsmasq

```

## Task7 → Clearly, the attacker’s goal is to impersonate the entire network. One workstation was already tricked and got its new malicious network configuration. What is the workstation’s hostname?

From the previous task, the attacker installed dnsmasq to simulate or configure a DHCP server and impersonate the entire network. You can check the tool’s man page to identify all related configuration files.
Search for the `dnsmasq.leases` file and dump it.

```bash
python3 vol.py -f memdump.mem linux.pagecache.InodePages --inode  0x9b33ac25b8c0 --dump

```

## Task8 → After receiving the new malicious network configuration, the user accessed the City of CogWork-1 internal portal from this workstation. What is their username?

You can use Bulk Extractor to extract network traffic from the memory dump and filter the HTTP traffic.

![Image](/images/write-up/HackTheBox_Sherlock_Holmes_The_Tunnel_Without_Walls/1_8_1.jpg)

## Task9 → TaskFinally, the user updated a software to the latest version, as suggested on the internal portal, and fell victim to a supply chain attack. From which Web endpoint was the update downloaded?

now the attacker can intercept and redirect traffic wherever they want Moreover the Bash history indicates that the attacker spawned a second Docker container after installing dnsmasq and interacting with iptables

![Image](/images/write-up/HackTheBox_Sherlock_Holmes_The_Tunnel_Without_Walls/1_9_2.jpg)

```bash
python3 volatility3/vol.py -f memdump.mem linux.pagecache.InodePages --inode  0x9b339df93420 --dump

```

![Image](/images/write-up/HackTheBox_Sherlock_Holmes_The_Tunnel_Without_Walls/1_9_3.jpg)

## Task10 → To perform this attack, the attacker redirected the original update domain to a malicious one. Identify the original domain and the final redirect IP address and port. (domain,IP:port)

The attacker can control the traffic after installing dnsmasq. Check the configuration files to determine where the attacker is redirecting the traffic

![Image](/images/write-up/HackTheBox_Sherlock_Holmes_The_Tunnel_Without_Walls/1_10_2.jpg)

However, this is not the final redirection. From the Bash history, you can see that the attacker created a default.conf file in the /tmp directory and removed it after running the Docker container
